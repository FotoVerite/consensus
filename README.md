Consensus
=========

A tool for reaching consensus on decisions.


## Documents

The practice of technical writing informs us of the best structures for
technical documents. A document should have multiple sections. Each section
has at least one paragraph and may have one or more enumerated paragraphs. A
paragraph is composed of sentences. Sentences are composed of clauses.

Each element of a document must be unambiguously and separately addressable.


## Conversations

Clarity in a conversation derives from the words chosen and the directness
with which documents, document parts, or other conversations can be
referenced.

Conversations are naturally a graph, not a tree. A comment in a conversation
must be able to reference multiple other elements.


## Revisions

Ideas must evolve. As changes are made, the holistic unity of a document and
its discussion must be retained for history to serve its purpose.
Conversations are relevant to the state of the document when it was discussed.
If a revision does not fulfill the purpose of the conversation, the
conversation should be enlarged to refer to more than one revision.


## Design

Layout and typography are essential to make information easy to read and
understand. Type must be large enough, but the absolute size depends on the
reader. The same is true of letter and line spacing. Lines must be short
enough that scanning them is not too strenuous.

The visual design of this app needs to prioritize for reading and
understanding technical text and discussions.
